# Some help are Welcome

## That's said, I need help to fix some issues and maybe enhance this game

1. Performance issues
    >The runtime complexity of this game is `horrible`
    + his is probably caused by the permutation generator function

2. Build a friendly User interface
    > At this state only programmer, or some user can use this game
    As on of my friends said when he saw me using the terminal to run some command:
    " You're a Hacker ?? "
